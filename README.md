 make the code as simple as possible for other programmers ,and You should always think about the control complexity and try to avoid errors that may make you add code that is not necessary and may affect the efficiency of the software.
 We must give maintenance and testing importance from the beginning of the project, so as not to make mistakes that may cost us a lot.
 And as a software developer, you must follow some practical steps, such as asking for help when needed, and not giving my opinion on something I don't know or I'm not sure about it and Refactoring should be the first option.*
